Russia has accused Washington of stoking "hysteria" over the crisis on the Ukrainian border, as the United Nations Security Council is due to discuss the simmering tensions later on Monday.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Washington and US outlets have played up fears of a Russian invasion.
"To our dismay, American media have lately been publishing a very large amount of unverified, distorted and deliberately deceitful information about what's happening in Ukraine and around it," Peskov said Monday.
"Hysteria hyped up by Washington is causing hysteria in Ukraine, almost to the point that people are packing their bags for the front. It's a fact," added Peskov, commenting on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's disagreements with the US on the level of the Russian threat.
